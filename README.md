# ML For Drug Discovery

## Course Description:
The role of machine learning in molecular modeling and drug discovery is rapidly growing.
This course introduces fundamental concepts and methods of chemoinformatics, structural biology, and
machine learning. Topics covered include molecular representations, physics based protein modeling,
ligand docking, chemical conformation generation, virtual screening, bioactivity data modeling,
chemical data curation, drug discovery pipeline, machine learning bioactivity prediction, deep-learning
architectures for molecular systems. We will discuss recent breakthroughs in applying scientific
foundation models and generalizability of predictions for drug discovery. Emphasis of the classes is in
understanding fundamental concepts in bioinformatics and practical application of data science tools
and methods to problems in medicinal chemistry and their own research. By the end of the course
students will be able to use ML models to tackle challenges in molecular modeling and drug discovery,
including defining objectives as quantifiable tasks, curating chemical, structural, and bioactivity data,
and appling state of the art machine learning methods.
